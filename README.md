# Rainy Days Jackets

A website selling rainjackets.

[Live site](https://oymel.netlify.com)

## Description

This is a website that primarily sell jackets, but also posts blog-posts about adventures where it would be natural to use one of their jackets.

- The first project we did at Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media.
- The site is a layer-upon-layer project worked on in many different subjects, and at many different times.
- The live site is functional and working, but I see several areas I might improve at a later time.

## Built With

Nothing too fancy in this project. Basic html and css for the site itself, javascript to fetch API-results from WordPress-database.
